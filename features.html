  <h1>Program 4 Features -- jofaulkn@ucsc.edu</h1>
  <p>The only feature that I wasn't able to implement from previous programs was Specular Lighting. The red cube was supposed to control the light source but instead it does nothing.</p>
  <p>The only special feature that I had time to implement was texture mapping. To choose a texture, click on the
  'Choose File' button where it says 'Select Texture', then to apply this new texture, press 'T' to set the active tool to 'Apply Texture',
  then click on the object to apply the texture. Since texture mapping is only called for in the fragment shader, shading with texture mapping will only work if Phong Shading is used.</p>
